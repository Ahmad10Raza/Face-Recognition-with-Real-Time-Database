# Face-Recognition-with-Real-Time-Database

**Description:**

This project implements real-time face recognition using computer vision techniques and integrates with a real-time database for efficient data management.

**Features:**

* Leverages facial landmarks for robust recognition under various lighting conditions.
* Employs a real-time database (specify the database used, e.g., Firebase) for storing and retrieving face recognition data.
* (Optional, if applicable) Streams video for continuous face detection and recognition.
* (Optional, if applicable) Provides user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

**Installation:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/Face-Recognition-with-Real-Time-Database.git]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Bash

   ```
   cd Face-Recognition-with-Real-Time-Database
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   (Replace `requirements.txt` with the actual file name if it's different.)

**Usage:**

1. **Configure the database:**

   * Follow the instructions provided by the specific database you're using (e.g., setting up a Firebase project, creating a database instance, and obtaining necessary credentials).
   * Update the code with the configuration details (replace with specific instructions based on your database):
     Python

     ```
     # Replace with your database configuration (e.g., connection strings, credentials)
     database_config = {
         # ...
     }
     ```
2. **Run the application:**

   ```
   python main.py
   ```
